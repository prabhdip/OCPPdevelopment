|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Reservation
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | The Central System issues a <<reserve-now,Reserve Now>> operation to the Charge Point to reserve a connector for use by a specific idTag.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes how the Charge Point reserves until a certain expiry time for a specific idTag.
                                     A reservation is released when the reserved idTag is used on the reserved connector (when specified) or on any connector (when unspecified)
                                     or when the expiry time is reached or when the reservation is explicitly canceled.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                      *1.* The Central System issues a <<reservenow.req,ReserveNow.req>> to a Charge Point to
                                      reserve a connector for use by a specific idTag. +
                                      *2.* Upon receipt of a <<reservenow.req,ReserveNow.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond with a
                                      <<reservenow.conf,ReserveNow.conf>> PDU. +
                                      *3.*  If the reservationId does not match any reservation in the Charge Point,
                                      then the Charge Point SHALL return the status value ‘Accepted’ if it
                                      succeeds in reserving a connector. +
                                      *4.* If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon
                                      receipt of a <<reservenow.conf,ReserveNow.conf>> PDU the Charge Point SHALL update the
                                      cache entry.

|       | _Alternative scenarios_   | *1.* Termination of reservation. +
                                      *2.* Cancel a reservation - The Central System sends an <<cancelreservation.req,CancelReservation.req>>
                                      PDU to the Charge Point
                                      to cancel the reservation of a connector. +
                                      If the Charge Point has a reservation matching the reservationId in the request PDU, it SHALL return
                                      status ‘Accepted’. Otherwise it SHALL return ‘Rejected’.

|*5*    | *Prerequisites*           |
                                      *1.* The Profile _Reservation_ is installed.
                                      *2.* The Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache.
                                      *3.* If the reservationId does not match any reservation in the Charge Point.
                                      *4.* Refuse charging for all incoming idTags on the reserved connector.
                                      *5.* A reservation is released when the reserved idTag is used on the reserved connector (when specified) or on any connector (when unspecified)
                                       or when the expiry time is reached or when the reservation is explicitly canceled.

|*6*    | *Postconditions*          | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                      The Charge Point is successfully reserved until a certain expiry time for a specific idTag.
                                      *Failure postcondition:* +
                                      The Charge Point failed to using the <<reserve-now,Reserve Now>> operation.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
                                      The Charge Point SHALL return
                                      ‘Occupied’ if the Charge Point or the specified connector are occupied. +
                                      The Charge Point SHALL also return ‘Occupied’ when the Charge Point or
                                      connector has been reserved for the same or another idTag. + The Charge
                                      Point SHALL return ‘Faulted’ if the Charge Point or the connector are in the
                                      Faulted state. + The Charge Point SHALL return ‘Unavailable’ if the Charge
                                      Point or connector are in the Unavailable state. The Charge Point SHALL
                                      return ‘Rejected’ if it is configured not to accept reservations.

|*9*    | *Remarks*                | It is RECOMMENDED to validate the Identifier with an <<authorize.req,authorize.req>> after reception of a <<reservenow.req,ReserveNow.req>> and before the start of the transaction.
