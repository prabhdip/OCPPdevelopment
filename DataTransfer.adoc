|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Central System sends information to a Charge Point for a function not supported by OCPP with a <<datatransfer.req,DataTransfer.req>> PDU. . +

|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | *1.* If the recipient of the request has no implementation for the specific
                                      vendorId it returns a status ‘UnknownVendor’ and the data element
                                      SHALL not be present.

                                     The <<datatransfer.req,DataTransfer.req>> PDU is received successfully.

                                     usage of status ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’ and the data element is part of
                                     the vendor-specific agreement between the parties involved.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                      This section is informative. +

                                      The mechanism of vendor-specific data transfer allows for the exchange
                                      of data or messages not standardized in OCPP . As such, it offers a
                                      framework within OCPP for experimental functionality that may find its
                                      way into future OCPP versions. Experimenting can be done without
                                      creating new (possibly incompatible) OCPP dialects. Secondly, it offers
                                      a possibility to implement additional functionality agreed upon between
                                      specific Central System and Charge Point vendors. +

                                      The operation Vendor Specific Data MAY be initiated either by the
                                      Central System or by the Charge Point. +

                                      IMPORTANT: Please use with extreme caution and only for optional
                                      functionality, since it will impact your compatibility with other
                                      systems that do not make use of this option. We recommend mentioning the
                                      usage explicitly in your documentation and/or communication. Please
                                      consider consulting the Open Charge Alliance before turning to this option to
                                      add functionality.
