|*1*    | *Use case element name*   | Set Charging Profile
|*2*    | *ID*                      | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*            | To set a charging profile at a Charge Point.
|*4*    | *Description*             | This use case describes the possibility to set a charging profile within Smart Charging;
                                      a charging profile consists of a charging schedule, which is basically a list of time intervals with
                                      their maximum charge power or current, and some values to specify the time period and recurrence of
                                      the schedule.
|       | _Actors_                  | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_    | The Central System can send a <<setchargingprofile.req,SetChargingProfile.req>> to a Charge Point, to set a charging profile.
|       | *_Alternative scenarios_* | _The following situations apply:_
| _a_   | _Start of Transaction_    |
                                      If the Central System receives a
                                      <<starttransaction.req,StartTransaction.req>> the Central System
                                      SHALL respond with a <<starttransaction.conf,StartTransaction.conf>>.
                                      If there is a need for a charging profile, The Central System MAY
                                      choose to send a <<setchargingprofile.req,SetChargingProfile.req>>
                                      to the Charge Point. +
                                      It is RECOMMENDED to check the timestamp in the <<starttransaction.req,StartTransaction.req>> PDU prior to sending a
                                      charging profile to check if the transaction is likely to be still ongoing. The <<starttransaction.req,StartTransaction.req>>
                                      might have been cached during an _offline_ period.
| _b_  | _remotestarttransaction.req_|

                                      The Central System MAY include a charging profile in a <<remotestarttransaction.req,RemoteStartTransaction>> request.
                                      If the Central System includes a <<chargingprofile,ChargingProfile>>, the ChargingProfilePurpose MUST be set to TxProfile. +
                                      **[NOTE]** +
                                      The Charge Point SHOULD add the TransactionId to the received profile once the transaction is reported to the central system.

| _c_  | _During a Transaction_  |

                                       The Central System MAY send a charging profile to a Charge Point to
                                       update the charging profile for that transaction. The Central System
                                       SHALL use the <<setchargingprofile.req,SetChargingProfile.req>> PDU
                                       for that purpose. If a charging profile
                                       with the same <<chargingprofileid,chargingProfileId>>, or the same combination
                                       of <<stacklevel,stackLevel>> / <<charging-profile-purpose,ChargingProfilePurpose>>, exists
                                       on the Charge Point, the new charging profile SHALL replace the existing
                                       charging profile, otherwise it SHALL be added. +
                                       The Charge Point SHALL then re-evaluate its collection
                                       of charge profiles to determine which charging profile will become active.
                                       In order to ensure that the updated charging profile applies only to the current
                                       transaction, the <<charging-profile-purposes,chargingProfilePurpose>> of the
                                       <<chargingprofile,ChargingProfile>> MUST be set to <<txprofile,TxProfile>>. +
                                       (See section: <<charging-profile-purposes,Charging Profile Purposes>>)

| _d_ | _Outside a Transaction_ |

                                        The Central System MAY send charging profiles to a Charge Point that are
                                        to be used as default charging profiles. The Central System SHALL use
                                        the <<setchargingprofile.req,SetChargingProfile.req>> PDU for that purpose.
                                        Such charging profiles MAY be sent at any time. If a charging profile
                                        with the same <<chargingprofileid,chargingProfileId>>, or the same combination of
                                        <<stacklevel,stackLevel>> / <<charging-profile-purpose,ChargingProfilePurpose>>, exists
                                        on the Charge Point, the new charging profile SHALL replace the existing
                                        charging profile, otherwise it SHALL be added. The Charge Point SHALL
                                        then re-evaluate its collection of charge profiles to determine which
                                        charging profile will become active. +

                                         **[NOTE]** +
                                         It is not possible to set a <<chargingprofile, ChargingProfile>> with purpose set to
                                         <<txprofile,TxProfile>> without presence of an active transaction, or in advance of a transaction. +

                                         **[NOTE]** +
                                         When a <<chargingprofile, ChargingProfile>> is refreshed during execution, it is advised
                                         to put the startSchedule of the new <<chargingprofile, ChargingProfile>> in the past, so there is no period of
                                         default charging behaviour inbetween the ChargingProfiles. The Charge Point SHALL continue to execute the existing
                                         <<chargingprofile, ChargingProfile>>
                                         until the new <<chargingprofile, ChargingProfile>> is installed. +

                                         **[NOTE]** +
                                         If the <<chargingscheduleperiod,chargingSchedulePeriod>> is longer than _duration_, the remainder periods SHALL
                                         not be executed. If duration is longer than the <<chargingscheduleperiod,chargingSchedulePeriod>>, the Charge Point
                                         SHALL keep the value of the last <<chargingscheduleperiod,chargingSchedulePeriod>> until _duration_ has ended. +

                                         **[NOTE]** +
                                         When <<recurrencykindtype, recurrencyKind>> is used in combination with a <<chargingschedule, chargingSchedule>>
                                         _duration_ shorter than the <<recurrencykindtype, recurrencyKind>> period, the Charge Point SHALL fall back to default
                                         behaviour after the <<chargingschedule, chargingSchedule>> _duration_ ends.

| _e_ | _Clear Charging Profile_ | If the Central System wishes to clear some or all of the charging
                                    profiles that were previously sent the Charge Point, it SHALL use the
                                    <<clearchargingprofile.req,ClearChargingProfile.req>> PDU.

                                    The Charge Point SHALL respond with a
                                    <<clearchargingprofile.conf,ClearChargingProfile.conf>> PDU
                                    specifying whether it was able to process the request.

=== Charging Profile Types

There are three different types of charging profiles, depending on their
purpose:

[[chargepointmaxprofile]]
* _ChargePointMaxProfile_

In load balancing scenarios, the Charge Point has one or more
local charging profiles that limit the power or current to be shared by all connectors
of the Charge Point. The Central System SHALL configure such a profile
with ChargingProfilePurpose set to “_ChargePointMaxProfile_”. _ChargePointMaxProfile_
can only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId 0.

[[txdefaultprofile]]
* _TxDefaultProfile_

Default schedules for new transactions MAY be used to impose charging policies.
An example could be a policy that prevents charging during the day.
For schedules of this purpose, ChargingProfilePurpose SHALL be set
to _TxDefaultProfile_.

_If TxDefaultProfile is set to ConnectorId 0, the TxDefaultProfile is applicable to all Connectors._

_If ConnectorId is set >0, it only applies to that specific connector._

_In the event a TxDefaultProfile for connector 0 is installed, and the Central System sends a new profile with ConnectorId >0, the TxDefaultProfile SHALL be replaced only for that specific connector._

[[txprofile]]
* _TxProfile_

If a transaction-specific profile with purpose _TxProfile_ is present,
it SHALL overrule the default charging profile with purpose
<<txdefaultprofile,TxDefaultProfile>> for the duration of the current transaction only.
After the transaction is stopped, the profile SHOULD be deleted.
If there is no transaction active on the connector specified in a charging
profile of type _TxProfile_, then the Charge Point SHALL discard it
and return an error status in <<setchargingprofile.conf,SetChargingProfile.conf>>.

The final schedule constraints that apply to a transaction are
determined by merging the profiles with purposes _ChargePointMaxProfile_
with the profile _TxProfile_ or the <<txdefaultprofile,TxDefaultProfile>> in case no profile
of purpose _TxProfile_ is provided.
_TxProfile SHALL only be set at Charge Point ConnectorId >0._
