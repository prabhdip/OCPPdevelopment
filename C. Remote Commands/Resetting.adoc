|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Resetting
|       | _Functional Block_       | C. Remote Commands
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | The Central System sends a <<reset.conf, Reset.conf>> PDU for requesting a Charge Point to reset itself.
|*4*    | *Description*            | The Charge Points sends a request to the Central System with information about its configuration (e.g.
                                     version, vendor, etc.).The Central System responds to indicate whether it will accept the Charge Point.
|       | _Actors_                 | CPO, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                     *1.* Persistent states: for example: Connector set to Unavailable shall persist a reboot. +
                                     *2.* At receipt of a soft reset, the Charge Point SHALL return to a state that behaves as just having been
                                     booted. If any transaction is in progress it SHALL be terminated normally, before the reset, as in Stop Transaction. +
                                     *3.* At receipt of a hard reset the Charge Point SHALL attempt to terminate any transaction in progress normally as in
                                     StopTransaction and then perform a reboot.

|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | *1.* Hard / soft reset without transaction. +
                                     *2.* Hard / soft reset with transaction.
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The Profile _Reservation_ is installed.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point is able to reset itself.
                                     *Failure postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point is _not_ able to reset itself.
                                     The Charge Point terminated any transaction in progress normally as in StopTransaction and then perform a reboot.
