|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Unlock Connector
|       | _Functional Block_       | C. Remote Commands
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To remotely unlock connector of the Charge Point.
|*4*    | *Description*            | The Central System can request a Charge Point to unlock a connector.
|       | _Actors_                 | External Trigger, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                     *1.* The Charge Point sends an <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU. +
                                     *2.* Upon receipt of an <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU, the Charge Point SHALL respond
                                     with a <<unlockconnector.conf,UnlockConnector.conf>> PDU. +
                                     *3.* The response PDU SHALL indicate whether the Charge Point was able to unlock its connector.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
                                     *1.* Unlock Connector (no running transaction)  (link to relevant use case) +
                                     *2.* Unlock Connector (running transaction) (link to relevant use case)
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The _Core Profile_ is installed. +
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point was able to unlock the connector.
                                     *Failure postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point was _not_ able to unlock the connector.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         | *ConnectorLockFailure* Failure to lock or unlock connector. +
                                     *UnlockCommand* | Central System sent an Unlock Connector command.
|       | *Non-happy flows*        | Unlock Connector - Not supported. +
                                     Unlock Connector - Unlock failure. +
                                     Unlock Connector - Unknown Connector.
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                     *.1* The <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> SHOULD NOT be used to remotely stop a running
                                     transaction, use the <<remote-stop-transaction,Remote Stop Transaction>> instead. +
                                     *2.* If there was a transaction in progress on the specific connector, then
                                     Charge Point SHALL finish the transaction first as described in
                                     <<stop-transaction,Stop Transaction>>. +
                                     *3.* <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> is intented only for unlocking the
                                     cable retention lock on the Connector, not for unlocking a connector access door.
