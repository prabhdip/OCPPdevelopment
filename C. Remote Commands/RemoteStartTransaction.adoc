[[ConfigurationKeys]]
== Configuration Keys


The effect of the RemoteStartTransaction.req message depends on the value of the
<<configkey-authorize-remote-tx-requests, `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests`>> configuration key in the Charge Point.

 * If the value of `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests` is _true_, the Charge Point SHALL behave as if in response to a local action at the Charge Point to start a transaction with the idTag given in the RemoteStartTransaction.req message. This means that the Charge Point will first try to authorize the idTag, using the <<localauthorizationlist, Local Authorization List>>, <<authorization-cache, Authorization Cache>> and/or an <<authorize.req, Authorize.req>> request. A transaction will only be started after authorization was obtained.

 * If the value of `AuthorizeRemoteTxRequests` is _false_, the Charge Point SHALL immediately try to start a transaction for the idTag given in the RemoteStartTransaction.req message. Note that after the transaction has been started, the Charge Point will send a <<start-transaction, StartTransaction>> request to the Central System, and the Central System will check the authorization status of the idTag when processing this StartTransaction request.
