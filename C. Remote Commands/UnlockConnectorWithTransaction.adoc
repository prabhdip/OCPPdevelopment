|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*

|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | *1.* To  (remotely)unlock a connector of a Charge Point. +
                                     *2.* To help EV drivers that have problems unplugging
                                      their cable from the Charge Point in case of malfunction of the Connector cable retention.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case covers how the Central System requests the Charge Point to unlock the connector.
|       | _Actors_                 | External Trigger, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                     *1.* The Central System  requests a Charge Point to unlock a connector.
                                     To do so, the Charge Point SHALL send an
                                     <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU. +
                                     *2.* Upon receipt of an <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> PDU, the Charge Point responds with a <<unlockconnector.conf,UnlockConnector.conf>> PDU. +
                                     *3.* The response PDU indicates whether the Charge Point was able to unlock its connector. +
                                     *4.*  If there was a transaction in progress on the specific connector, then
                                     Charge Point SHALL finish the transaction first as described in
                                     <<stop-transaction,Stop Transaction>>.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | *1.* Unlock connector with/without running transaction. (link to relevant use case)
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          |
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | **Successful postcondition:**
                                     *Failure postcondition:*
|*7*    | *Sequence diagram*       |
|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
                                      *1.* Unlock connector - not supported
                                      *2.* Unlock connector - unlock failure
                                      *3.* Unlock connector - unknown connector
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                      IMPORTANT: <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> is intented only for unlocking the cable retention lock on the Connector, not for unlocking a connector access door.
