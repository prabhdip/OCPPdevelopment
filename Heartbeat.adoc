|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Heartbeat
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To let the Central System know that a Charge Point is still connected, a
                                     Charge Point sends a heartbeat after a configurable time interval.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes the possibility to ensuring for the Central System that a Charge Point is still alive.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                      *1.* The Charge Point sends a <<heartbeat.req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU
                                      for ensuring that the Central System knows that a Charge Point is still
                                      alive. +
                                      *2.* Upon receipt of a <<heartbeat.req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU, the Central System responds
                                      with a <<heartbeat.conf,Heartbeat.conf>>. The response PDU
                                      contains the current time of the Central System, which is RECOMMENDED to be used by the Charge Point to
                                      synchronize its internal clock.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The _Core Profile_ is installed. +
                                     The heartbeat interval is set.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postconditions:*: +
                                     The Heartbeat is received, the Charge Point is _alive_. +
                                     *Failure postconditions:* +
                                     The Heartbeat is _not_ received, the Charge Point is _offline_.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |  The Charge Point MAY skip sending a <<heartbeat.req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU when another PDU has
                                      been sent to the Central System within the configured heartbeat
                                      interval. This implies that a Central System SHOULD assume availability
                                      of a Charge Point whenever a PDU has been received, the same way as it
                                      would have, when it received a <<heartbeat.req,Heartbeat.req>> PDU. +
                                      *[NOTE]* +
                                      With JSON over WebSocket, sending heartbeats is not mandatory. However, for time synchronization
                                      it is advised to at least send one heartbeat per 24 hour.
