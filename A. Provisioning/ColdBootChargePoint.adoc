|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                     Most Charge Points boot up and send StatusNotifications with _Unavailable_ then do a check of all the hardware and send new StatusNotifications with status _Available_ when the Charge Point is up and running.
                                     When something is wrong with the Charge Point or connector, the status should be set to _Faulted_. Persistent states: for example: Connector set to _Unavailable_ shall persist a reboot.

[[chargepointstatus]]
=== ChargePointStatus
_Enumeration_

Status reported in <<statusnotification.req,StatusNotification.req>>. A status can be reported for the Charge Point main controller (connectorId = 0) or for a specific connector. Status for the Charge Point main controller is a subset of the enumeration: _Available_, _Unavailable_ or _Faulted_.

States considered Operative are: _Available_, _Preparing_, _Charging_, _SuspendedEVSE_, _SuspendedEV_, _Finishing_, _Reserved_.
States considered Inoperative are: _Unavailable_, _Faulted_.

|*Preparing*|When a Connector becomes no longer available for a new user but no charging session is active. Typically a Connector is occupied when a user presents a tag, inserts a cable or a vehicle occupies the parking bay +
(Operative)
|*Charging*|When the contactor of a Connector closes, allowing the vehicle to charge +
(Operative)
|*SuspendedEVSE*|When the contactor of a Connector opens upon request of the EVSE, e.g. due to a smart charging restriction or as the result of <<starttransaction.conf,StartTransaction.conf>> indicating that charging is not allowed +
(Operative)
|*SuspendedEV*|When the EVSE is ready to deliver energy but contactor is open, e.g. the EV is not ready.
|*Finishing*|When a charging session has stopped at a Connector, but the Connector is not yet available for a new user, e.g. the cable has not been removed or the vehicle has not left the parking bay +
(Operative)
|*Reserved*|When a Connector becomes reserved as a result of a <<reserve-now,Reserve Now>> command +
(Operative)
|*Unavailable*|When a Connector becomes unavailable as the result of a Change Availability command or an event upon which the Charge Point transitions to unavailable at its discretion. Upon receipt of a <<change-availability,Change Availability>> command, the status MAY change immediately or the change MAY be scheduled. When scheduled, the <<status-notification,Status Notification>> shall be send when the availability change becomes effective +
