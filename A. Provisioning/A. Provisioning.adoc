[[scope]]
== Scope

This document defines the protocol used between a *Charge Point* and
**Central System** in use cases. If the protocol requires a certain action or
response from one side or the other, then this will be stated in this
document.

The specification does not define the communication technology. Any
technology will do, as long as it supports TCP/IP connectivity.

For complex systems, the use case methodology supports a common understanding of functionalities,
_Actors_and processes across different technical committees or even different organizations. Developed
as software engineering tool, the methodology can be used to support the development of standards as it
the analysis of requirements in relation to new or existing standards.

== Terminology and Conventions

[[conventions]]
=== Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]], subject to the following additional clarification clause:

The phrase “valid reasons in particular circumstances” relating to the usage of the terms “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, and “NOT RECOMMENDED” is to be taken to mean technically valid reasons, such as the absence of necessary hardware to support a function from a charge point design: for the purposes of this specification it specifically excludes decisions made on commercial, or other non-technical grounds, such as cost of implementation, or likelihood of use.

All sections and appendixes, except “Scope” and “Terminology and
Conventions”, are normative, unless they are explicitly indicated to be
informative.


[[definitions]]
=== Definitions

This section contains the terminology that is used throughout this
document.

[cols="3,8"]
|=======================================================================
|*Central System* |Charge Point Management System: the central system
that manages Charge Points and has the information for authorizing users
for using its Charge Points.

|*CiString* | Case Insensitive String. Only printable ASCII allowed.

|*Charge Point* |The Charge Point is the physical system where an
electric vehicle can be charged. A Charge Point has one or more
connectors.

|*Charging Profile* | Generic Charging Profile, used for different types of Profiles. Contains information about the Profile and holds the <<chargingschedule,Charging Schedule>>. In future versions of OCPP it might hold more than 1 <<chargingschedule,Charging Schedule>>.

|*Charging Schedule* | Part of a Charging Profile. Defines a block of charging Power or Current limits.
Can contain a start time and length.

|*Charging Session* |Part of a transaction during which the EV is allowed to request energy

|*Composite Charging Schedule* |The charging schedule as calculated by the Charge Point. It is the result of the calculation of all active schedules and possible local limits present in the Charge Point. Also IEC 15118 limits might be taken into account.

|*Connector* |The term “Connector”, as used in this specification,
refers to an independently operated and managed electrical outlet on a
Charge Point. This usually corresponds to a single physical connector,
but in some cases a single outlet may have multiple physical socket
types and/or tethered cable/connector arrangements to facilitate
different vehicle types (e.g. four-wheeled EVs and electric scooters).

|*Control Pilot signal* | signal used by a Charge Point to inform EV
of maximum Charging power or current limit, as defined by <<ref-IEC61851,[IEC61851-1]>>.

|[[energy-transfer-period]] *Energy Transfer Period* | Time during which an EV chooses to take offered energy, or return it. Multiple Energy Transfer Periods are possible during a Transaction.

|*Local Controller* |Optional device in a smart charging infrastructure. Located on the premises with a number of Charge Points connected to it. Sits between the Charge Points and Central System. Understands and speaks OCPP messages. Controls the Power or Current in other Charge Point by using OCPP smart charging messages. Can be a Charge Point itself.
|*OCPP-J*| OCPP via JSON over WebSocket
|*OCPP-S*| OCPP via SOAP
|*Phase Rotation*| Defines the wiring order of the phases between the energy meter (or if absent, the grid connection), and the Charge Point connector.

|[[transaction]] *Transaction* | The part of the charging process that starts when all relevant preconditions (e.g. authorization, plug inserted) are met, and ends at the moment when the Charge Point irrevocably leaves this state.

|*String* | Case Sensitive String. Only printable ASCII allowed.
All strings in messages and enumerations are case sensitive, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

|*No.* |*Type* | *Description*
|*1* | *Use case element name* | Cold Boot Charge Point
|*2* | *ID* | UC.01
|*3* | *Objective(s)* | Give the Central System a way to control which Charge Points are allowed to connect to the system.
|*4* | *Description* | This use case describes how the Central System can control Charge Point accessing its system. To be able to control Charge Points connecting to a Central System, Charge Points are required to send a BootNotification.req, this request contains some information about the Charge Point.
| | Actors| Charge Point, Central System
| | _Scenario description_| *1.* The Central System receives the status Rejected from the Charge Point. +
*2.* The Charge Point will resend the BootNotification.req every XX seconds (Interval from the BootNotification.conf) +
*3.* When the Central System returns with BootNotification.conf with the status accepted. +
*4.* UC.01 - Psychical Cold Boot Charge Point is valid.
| | _Alternative scenarios_ | UC.01a - First Boot Charge Point (pending) +
UC.01b - First Boot Charge Point (rejected)
|*5* | *Prerequisites* | The Charge Point is powered down.
|*6* | *postconditions* | The Charge Point is in _idle_ state, and _Accepted_.

|*8* | *Error handling* | No initial establishment of connection of high level communication between the Central System and Charge Point.
|*9* | *Remarks* | Most Charge Points boot up and send StatusNotifications with “Unavailable” then do a check of all the hardware and send new StatusNotifications with status “Available” when the Charge Point is up and running. +
When something is wrong with the Charge Point or connector, the status should be set to “Faulted”.
Persistent states: for example: Connector set to Unavailable shall persist a reboot.
