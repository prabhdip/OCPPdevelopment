|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | First Boot Charge Point (Pending)
|       | _Functional Block_       | A. Provisioning
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.01a
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | *1.* Give the Central System a way to control which Charge Points are allowed to connect to the system.
                                     *2.* To inform the Central System is currently in the _Pending_ status: +
                                     *3.* To retrieve or set certain configuration information. +
                                     *4.* To inform that the Central System might be not ready not the accept the Charge Point. CHECK
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes how the Central System can control Charge Point accessing its system. To be
                                     able to control Charge Points connecting to a Central System, Charge Points are required
                                     to send a <<BootNotification.req,BootNotification.req>>, this request contains some information about
                                     the Charge Point. This sub-use case particularly describes how the the Charge Point is in the _Pending_ status.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Charge Point is powered down. +
                                     *2.* The Charge Point sends a <<BootNotification.req,BootNotification.req>> PDU to the Central System. +
                                     *3.* The Central System receives the status _Pending_ from the Charge Point. +
                                     *4.* The Central System then, is able to send messages to the Charge Point in
                                     order to change the configuration of the Charge Point. +
                                     *5.* The Charge Point will resend the BootNotification.req every XX seconds
                                     (Interval from the <<bootNotification.conf, BootNotification.conf>>) +
                                     *6.* When the Central System returns with <<bootNotification.conf, BootNotification.conf>>
                                     with the status accepted, UC.01 - Psychical Cold Boot Charge Point is valid.

                                     UC.01b - First Boot Charge Point (Rejected) +
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | *1.* The Charge Point is powered down. +
                                     *2.* The Charge Point received the status _Pending_.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point is in _Idle_ state, and _Accepted_. +
                                     *Failure postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point received the status _Rejected_, <<UC.01b>> applies.
