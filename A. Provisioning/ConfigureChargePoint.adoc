|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Configure Charge Point
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.02
|       | _Functional Block_       | A. Provisioning
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To change the value of configuration parameters.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes how the Central System requests a Charge Point to change configuration parameters.
|       | _Actors_                 | Central System, Charge Point
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Central System sends a <<changeconfiguration.req,ChangeConfiguration.req>>. +
                                     *2.* Upon receipt of a <<changeconfiguration.req,ChangeConfiguration.req>> Charge Point replies with a
                                     <<changeconfiguration.conf,ChangeConfiguration.conf>> indicating whether it
                                     was able to executed the change. +
                                     *3.* If the change was executed successfully, the Charge Point responds with a status _Accepted_.
|       | Alternative scenario's   | *1.* Get Configuration (All Available Keys) (link to relevant use case??)
                                     *2.* Get Configuration (Specific Keys) (link to relevant use case??)
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | *1.* The _Core Profile_ is installed. +
                                     *2.* The Central System is able to request a Charge Point to change configuration parameters. +
                                     *3.* Only _Accepted_ only valid as response when charge point can change this configuration key to the requested value.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point was able to execute the configuration parameters are changed, the Charge Point
                                     responds with the status _Accepted_. +
                                     The change was executed successfully, but a reboot is needed to apply it. (link to relevant use case?)
                                     *Failure postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge failed to set the configuration parameters, the Charge Point responds with the status _Rejected_.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         | *1.* If "key" does not correspond to a configuration setting supported by Charge Point, it SHALL reply with a status _NotSupported_.

|*9*    | *Remarks*                | If a key value is defined as a CSL, it MAY be accompanied with a `[KeyName]MaxLength` key,
                                     indicating the max length of the CSL in items. If this key is not set, a safe value of 1 (one) item SHOULD be assumed. +
                                     If the list of keys in the request PDU is empty or missing (it is
                                     optional), the Charge Point SHALL return a list of all configuration
                                     settings in <<getconfiguration.conf,GetConfiguration.conf>>.
                                     Otherwise Charge Point SHALL return a list of recognized keys and their
                                     corresponding values and read-only state. Unrecognized keys SHALL be
                                     placed in the response PDU as part of the optional unknown key list
                                     element of <<getconfiguration.conf,GetConfiguration.conf>>. +
                                     The number of configuration keys requested in a single PDU MAY be limited by the
                                     Charge Point. This maximum can be retrieved by reading the configuration key <<configkey-get-configuration-max-keys, `GetConfigurationMaxKeys`>>. +
                                     _Accepted_ only valid as response when charge point can change this configuration key to the requested value.
