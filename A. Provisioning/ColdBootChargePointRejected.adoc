|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | First Boot Charge Point (Rejected)
|       | _Functional Block_       | A. Provisioning
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.01b
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | *1.* Give the Central System a way to control which Charge Points are allowed to connect to the system. +
                                     *2.* To inform the Charge Point that the Central System does not accept the Charge Point (yet).+
                                     *3.* The Charge Point should retry, as the Central System MAY accept the Charge Point at a later time.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes how the Central System can control Charge Point accessing its system. To be
                                     able to control Charge Points connecting to a Central System, Charge Points are required
                                     to send a <<BootNotification.req,BootNotification.req>>, this request contains some information about
                                     the Charge Point. This sub-use case particularly describes how the the Charge Point is in the _Rejected_ status.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Central System receives the status Rejected from the Charge Point.+
                                     *2.* The Charge Point will resend the BootNotification.req every XX seconds (Interval from the <<bootNotification.conf, BootNotification.conf>>) +
                                     *3.* When the Central System returns with <<bootNotification.conf,BootNotification.conf>> with the status accepted, UC.01 - Psychical Cold Boot Charge Point is valid.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The Charge Point is powered down. +
                                     The Charge Point received the status _Rejected_.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point is in _Idle_ state, and _Accepted_.

|*9*    | *Remarks*                | During the state Rejected, the Charge Point may no longer be reachable from the Central System. It
                                     MAY for instance close its communication channel or shut down its communication hardware. +
                                     Also the Central System MAY close the communication channel, for instance to free up system resources. CHECK
                                     It is advised not to accept any transactions until the BootNotification of the charge point has been accepted by the Central System.
