|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Change Availability
|       | _Functional Block_       | A. Provisioning
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.03
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To change to Charge Points' availability.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case covers how the Central System requests the Charge Point to change its availability. +
                                     A Charge Point is considered available (“operative”) when it is charging or
                                     ready for charging. A Charge Point is considered _Unavailable_ when it does
                                     not allow any charging.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                     *1.* The Central System sends a <<changeavailability.req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU for requesting a
                                     Charge Point to change its availability.  +
                                     *2.* The Central System changes the availability to _Available_ or _Unavailable_. +
                                     *3*. Upon receipt of a <<changeavailability.req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU, the Charge Point
                                     responds with a <<changeavailability.conf,ChangeAvailability.conf>> PDU. Status is defined. +
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
                                     *1.* When a transaction is in progress the Charge Point responds with availability status _Scheduled_ to
                                     indicate that it is scheduled to occur after the transaction has finished. +
                                     *2.* In the event that the Central System requests Charge Point to change to a
                                     status it is already in, the Charge Point responds with availability status _Accepted_.
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The Central System is able to the change the availability of the Charge Point _Available_ or _Unavailable_.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Central System was able to change the Charge Point's availability. +
                                     *Failure postcondition:* The Central System was _not_ able to change the requested availability.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         | Persistent states: for example: Connector set to _Una  vailable__ shall persist a reboot.
|*9*    | *Remarks*                | When an availability change requested with a <<changeavailability.req,ChangeAvailability.req>> PDU
                                     has happened, the Charge Point SHALL inform Central System of its new availability
                                     status with a <<statusnotification.req,StatusNotification.req>> as described
                                     there. +
                                     In the case the <<changeavailability.req, ChangeAvailability.req>> contains ConnectorId = 0, the status change
                                     applies to the Charge Point and all Connectors. +
                                     Persistent states: for example: Connector set to _Unavailable_ shall persist a reboot.
