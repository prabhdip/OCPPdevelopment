|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Offline Behavior
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.04
|       | _Functional Block_       | A. Provisioning
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To attain Stand alone operation of the Charge Point.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case describes that, in the event of unavailability of the communication,
                                     the Charge Point is designed to operate stand-alone. In that situation, the Charge Point is said to be _offline_.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Central System or communication is unavailable. +
                                     *2.* The Charge Point operates stand-alone. +
                                     *3.* The Charge Point allows automatic authorization of any presented identifier by either: +
                                     _a._ The Local Authorization List;  a list of identifiers that can be synchronized with the Central System. +
                                     _b._ Authorization Cache entries; that autonomously maintains a record of previously presented
                                     identifiers that have been successfully authorized by the Central System. (Successfully meaning:
                                     a response received on a message containing an idTag).
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | *1.* Offline authorization through the Local Authorization List. (link to relevant use case) +
                                     *2.* Offline authorization through Authorization Cache entries. (link to relevant use case) +

                                     *6.* Unknown Offline Authorization. (link to relevant use case)
|       | _Rationale_              | This allows (a) authorization of a user when offline, and (b) faster (apparent) authorization response
                                     time when communication between Charge Point and Central System is slow.
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | *1.* The _Core Profile_ is installed. +
                                     *2.* The Profile _Local Auth List Management_ is installed.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The Charge Point is able to operate stand alone. + CHECK
                                     *Failure postcondition:*
                                     The Charge Point is _not_ able to operate stand alone. CHECK

|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                      When _offline_, the Charge Point MUST queue any transaction-related messages that
                                      it would have sent to the Central System if the Charge Point had been online. +

                                      While not yet accepted by the Central System, the Charge Point may allow locally-authorized
                                      transactions if it is configured to do so, as described in <<local-authorization-and-offline-behavior,
                                      Local Authorization & Offline Behavior>>. Parties who want to implement this behavior must realize that
                                      it is uncertain if those transactions can ever be delivered to the Central System. +

                                      A Charge Point MAY support the (automatic) authorization of any presented identifier when _offline_, to avoid
                                      refusal of charging to bona-fide users that cannot be explicitly authorized by Local Authorization List/Authorization
                                      Cache entries. This functionality is explained in more detail in <<unknown-offline-authorization, Unknown Offline
                                      Authorization>>.
