|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Get Diagnostics
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To request the Charge Point for for diagnostic information.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case covers the functionality of getting the diagnostics of a Charge Point.
                                     The Central System  requests a Charge Point for diagnostic information.
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                      *1.* The Central System requests a Charge Point for diagnostic information. +
                                      *2.* The Central System sends a <<getdiagnostics.req,GetDiagnostics.req>> PDU for getting
                                      diagnostic information of a Charge Point with a location where the Charge
                                      Point uploads its diagnostic data to and optionally a begin and end
                                      time for the requested diagnostic information. +
                                      *3.* Upon receipt of a <<getdiagnostics.req,GetDiagnostics.req>> PDU, and if diagnostics information
                                      is available then Charge Point responds with a
                                      <<getdiagnostics.conf,GetDiagnostics.conf>> PDU stating the name of the
                                      file containing the diagnostic information that will be uploaded. +
                                      *4*. The  Charge Point uploads a single file. The format of the diagnostics file is not prescribed.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | The Profile _Firmware Management_ is installed.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:* +
                                     The upload of diagnostics is busy or has finished _successfully_. +
                                     *Failure postcondition:* +
                                     The upload of diagnostics is busy or has finished _failed_.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         | If no diagnostics file is available, then <<getdiagnostics.conf,GetDiagnostics.conf>> SHALL NOT contain a file name.
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |
                                     When a Charge Point is requested to upload a diagnostics file, the Central
                                     System supplies in the request an URL where the Charge Point should upload
                                     the file. The URL also contains the protocol which must be used to
                                     upload the file. +

                                     It is recommended that the diagnostics file is downloaded via FTP or FTPS.
                                     FTP(S) is better optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S)
                                     has the ability to resume uploads. In case an upload is interrupted, the
                                     Charge Point can resume uploading after the part it already has uploaded.
                                     The FTP URL is of format: __ftp:__//__user__:__password__@__host__:__port__/_path_ in
                                     which the parts __user__:__password__@, :__password__ or :__port__ may
                                     be excluded.
