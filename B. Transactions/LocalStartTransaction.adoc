|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Local start transaction
|*2*    | *ID* |                   | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | Establish a transaction between Charge Point and Central System.
|*4*    | *Description*            | In order to start the transaction, the user shows a physical RFID
                                     card to the card reader of the Charge Point, in this way the user is authorized to start the transaction;
                                     the vehicle starts charging. When the user starts charging, communication between the Central System and
                                     the Charge Point is initiated.
|       | _Actors_                 | User, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                      *1.* The Charge Point informs Central System that a transaction has started. +
                                      *2.* Setting a charging profile at start of a transaction. +
                                      *3.* Setting charging profile during a transaction. +
                                      *4.* Setting a charging profile outside of a transaction. +
                                      *5.* Apply sanity checks.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_   |

|*5*    | *Prerequisites*           | The _Core Profile_ is installed.

                                        *1.* If the presented idTag is the same as the idTag presented to start the transaction.
                                        *2.* If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache.

|*6*    | *Postconditions*          |   *Successful postcondition:* +
                                        The Charge Point succeeds to respond with a <<starttransaction.conf,StartTransaction.conf>>
                                        *Failure postcondition:* +
                                        The Charge Point fails to respond with a <<starttransaction.conf,StartTransaction.conf>>.

                                        *.1* if the idTag is not in the <<localauthorizationlist,Local Authorization List>>,
                                        with the <<idtaginfo,IdTagInfo>> value from the response as described under <<authorization-cache, Authorization Cache>>. +
                                        *2.*  Failing to respond with a <<starttransaction.conf,StartTransaction.conf>> will only cause the Charge Point to try the same message
                                        again as specified in <<transaction-message-error-responses>>.
