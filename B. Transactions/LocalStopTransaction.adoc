Functional Block: B. Transactions +

[cols="^0,2,6",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Local stop transaction
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | The charging transaction needs to be stopped.
|*4*    | *Description*            | When the user wants to leave the charging station, the user shows the RFID card to the
                                     card Reader of the Charge Point to stop the transaction, the vehicle stops charging. When
                                     the user stops charging, communication between the Central System and the Charge Point is ended.

|       | _Actors_                 | User, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                     *1.* The User presents his identification to stop the transaction.
                                     *2.* A transaction is stopped +
                                     *3.* The Charge Point sends a <<stoptransaction.req,StopTransaction.req>> +
                                     *4.* The Central System responds with a <<stoptransaction.conf, StopTransaction.conf>> PDU. +
                                     *5.* If the Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon
                                     receipt of a <<stoptransaction.conf, StopTransaction.conf>> PDU the Charge Point updates the
                                     cache entry.

|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
                                     *1.* The Charge Point MAY unlock the cable (if not permanently attached) when the cable is disconnected at the EV.
                                        If supported, this functionality is reported and controlled by the configuration key <<configkey-unlock-connector-on-ev-side-disconnect,
                                        `UnlockConnectorOnEVSideDisconnect`>>. +

                                      *2.* The Charge Point MAY stop a running transaction when the cable is disconnected at the EV.
                                      If supported, this functionality is reported and controlled by the configuration key <<configkey-stop-transaction-on-ev-side-disconnect,
                                      `StopTransactionOnEVSideDisconnect`>>.

|*5*    | *Prerequisites*           | The _Core Profile_ is installed.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*          |   *Successful postcondition:* +
                                        The Charge Point succeeds to respond with a <<stoptransaction.conf,StopTransaction.conf>>
                                        *Failure postcondition:* +
                                        The Charge Point fails to respond with a <<stoptransaction.conf,StopTransaction.conf>>.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         | <see RequirementsStartStopTransaction.adoc>
|*9*    | *Remarks*                |  The Central System cannot prevent a transaction from stopping. It MAY only
                                      inform the Charge Point it has received the <<stoptransaction.req,StopTransaction.req>>
                                      and MAY send information about the idTag used to stop the transaction.
                                      This information SHOULD be used to update the <<authorization-cache,Authorization Cache>>, if implemented.
