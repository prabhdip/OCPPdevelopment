===  UC.XX - Unknown Offline Authorization +

Functional Block: D. Authentication

[cols="^0,2,6",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Unknown Offline Authorization
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX (sub to Offline Behavior)
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To allow automatic authorization of any "unknown" identifiers that cannot be explicitly authorized by Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache entries.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use cases describes the scenario of presented "unknown" identifiers other that are present in a Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache entries.
|       | _Actors_                 | EV user, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   |
                                      *1.* The Charge Point allows automatic authorization of any "unknown" identifiers.
                                      *2.* The Charge Point rejects identifiers that are present in a Local Authorization List that have a status other than “Accepted” (Invalid, Blocked, Expired)
                                      *3.* The Connection is restored.
                                      *4.* the Charge Point SHALL send a <<start-transaction, Start Transaction>> request for any transaction that was authorized _offline_.

|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | n/a
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | When _offline_.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postcondition:*  +
                                      When the authorization status in the <<starttransaction.conf>> is _Accepted_
                                      *Failure postcondition:* +
                                      When the authorization status in the <<starttransaction.conf>> is _not Accepted_.
|*7*    | *Sequence diagram*       |
|*8*    | *Error handling*         |

                                    When the authorization status in the <<starttransaction.conf>> is not _Accepted_, and the transaction is still ongoing, the Charge Point SHOULD:

                                    When <<configkey-stop-transaction-on-invalid-id,`StopTransactionOnInvalidId`>>
                                    is set to _true_: stop the transaction normally as
                                    stated in <<stop-transaction, Stop Transaction>>. The <<reason,Reason>> field in the <<stop-transaction, Stop Transaction>> request should be set to _DeAuthorized_.
                                    If the Charge Point has the possibility to lock the Charging Cable, it SHOULD keep the Charging Cable locked until the owner presents his identifier. +
                                    When <<configkey-stop-transaction-on-invalid-id,`StopTransactionOnInvalidId`>>
                                    is set to _false_: only stop energy delivery to the
                                    vehicle. +

                                    *[NOTE]*
                                    In the case of an invalid identifier, an operator MAY choose to charge the EV with a minimum amount of energy so the EV is able to drive away. This amount is controlled by
                                    the optional configuration key: <<configkey-max-energy-on-invalid-id,`MaxEnergyOnInvalidId`>>.
