|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | User Authentication
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.02
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*             | Before the owner of an electric vehicle can start or stop charging, the Charge Point has to authorize the operation.
|*4*    | *Description*            | When a Charge Point needs to charge an electric vehicle, it needs to authenticate the User first before the charging can be started. If the User is authorized the Charge Point informs the Central System that it has started with charging.
                                      *1.* Local authorization through authorization cache (i.e. valid identifier) +
                                      *2.* Authorization through local authorization list (i.e. valid identifier) +
                                      *3.* Send local list
|       | _Actors_                  | User, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_    |
                                      *1.* The User wants to charge the electric vehicle. +
                                      *2.* The Charge Point needs to authorize the operation. +
                                      *3.* The Charge Point sends an Authorize.req PDU to the Central System to request authorization. +
                                      *4.* Upon receipt of an Authorize.req PDU, the Central System responds with an Authorize.conf PDU. (This response PDU SHALL indicate whether or not the idTag is accepted by the Central System). +
                                      *5.* If the Central System accepts the idTag include san authorization status value indicating acceptance or a reason for rejection.+
                                      *6.* If the Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache, then upon receipt of an Authorize.conf PDU the Charge Point updates the cache entry.

|       | _Alternative scenarios_  | *1.* Authorize invalid / blocked / expired
                                     *2.* Unknown Offline Authorization

|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          |  *1.* The Charge Point SHALL only supply energy after authorization.
                                      *2.* If the Central System accepts the idTag. +
                                      *3.* If Charge Point has implemented an Authorization Cache.
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         |  **Successful postcondition:**
                                     *Failure postcondition:*
                                     The user is authenticated and can start or stop charging.

|*9*    | *Remarks*                |  If an idTag presented by the user is not present in the Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache,
                                      then the Charge Point SHALL send an <<authorize.req, Authorize.req>> PDU to the Central System to request
                                      authorization. If the idTag is present in the Local Authorization List or Authorization Cache, then the
                                      Charge Point MAY send an <<authorize.req, Authorize.req>> PDU to the Central System.
