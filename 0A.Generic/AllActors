| Actor name       | Actor type | Actor description
| User             | Actor      | The user of a charge point and the electric vehicle.
| Connector        | Subsystem  | The term “Connector”, as used in this specification, refers to an independently
                                  operated and managed electrical outlet on a Charge Point. This usually corresponds
                                  to a single physical connector, but in some cases a single outlet may have multiple
                                  physical socket types and/or types (e.g. four-wheeled EVs and electric scooters).
| CPO              | Actor      | Charge Point Operator
| Central System   | Subsystem  | Charge Point Management System: the central system that manages Charge Points and has the
                                  information for authorizing users for using its Charge Points.
| Charge Point     | Device     | The Charge Point is the physical system where an electric vehicle can be charged. A Charge
                                  Point has one or more connectors.
| Charge Point Operator | Actor | Entity with which the customer has a contract related to all the services to the EV operation.
| Electric Vehicle | Device     | Electric vehicle, distributed energy resource with a remote battery and socket.

*Primary actors*
_Role involved directly in the charging process_.
* Electric Vehicle
Any vehicle propelled by an electric motor drawing current from a rechargeable storage battery or from other portable energy storage devices (rechargeable, using energy from a source off the vehicle such as a residential or public electric service), which is manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads or highways.
[ISO 15118-1:2013]
* Electric Vehicle User
Person or legal entity using the vehicle and providing information about driving needs and consequently influences charging patterns.
NOTE: Driving needs such as range and time of availability are necessary to achieve the most appropriate charging scenario.

''''

Following IEC 62559-2:2015, the actor list contains the following information for each actor:

* Area +
_Example:_ Smart Grid/energy systems.
* Mapping to grouping +
_Example:_ To sort requirements for "smart metering" within the area "energy system".
* Name of the actor +
_Example:_ Distribution system operator (DSO).
* Abbreviation for the actor name +
_Example:_ DSO.
* Actor type (e.g. roles, application, ...) +
_Example:_ DSO is a role, an energy management system (EMS) is an application.
* Definition of actor +
Here the actor shall be described. Usually the actor is taken from an existing actor list so that the definition already exists.
* Possible actors fulfilling this role +
_Example:_ For the actor “meter operator” it might be a DSO or an independent meter operator, depending on the national background or the specific project.
* International, regional or national relevance
Actors might differentiate in definition depending on regional or national legislation or markets.
* Source of the definition +
Actors should be based as far as possible on existing data models in the relevant area or domain.
_Example:_ Data models like CIM common information model (IEC 61968/61970) or COSEM in the metering domain (IEC 62056).
* Parent +
This column is used to build up a kind of hierarchy of actors.
_Example:_ A grid operator as parent of transmission or distribution system operator (TSO or DSO).
