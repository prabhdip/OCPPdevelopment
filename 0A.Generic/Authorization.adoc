[[scope]]
== Scope

This document defines the protocol used between a *Charge Point* and
**Central System** in use cases. If the protocol requires a certain action or
response from one side or the other, then this will be stated in this
document.

The specification does not define the communication technology. Any
technology will do, as long as it supports TCP/IP connectivity.

For complex systems, the use case methodology supports a common understanding of functionalities,
_Actors_and processes across different technical committees or even different organizations. Developed
as software engineering tool, the methodology can be used to support the development of standards as it
the analysis of requirements in relation to new or existing standards.

== Terminology and Conventions

[[conventions]]
=== Conventions

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]], subject to the following additional clarification clause:

The phrase “valid reasons in particular circumstances” relating to the usage of the terms “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, and “NOT RECOMMENDED” is to be taken to mean technically valid reasons, such as the absence of necessary hardware to support a function from a charge point design: for the purposes of this specification it specifically excludes decisions made on commercial, or other non-technical grounds, such as cost of implementation, or likelihood of use.

All sections and appendixes, except “Scope” and “Terminology and
Conventions”, are normative, unless they are explicitly indicated to be
informative.


[[definitions]]
=== Definitions

This section contains the terminology that is used throughout this
document.

[cols="3,8"]
|=======================================================================
|*Central System* |Charge Point Management System: the central system
that manages Charge Points and has the information for authorizing users
for using its Charge Points.

|*CiString* | Case Insensitive String. Only printable ASCII allowed.

|*Charge Point* |The Charge Point is the physical system where an
electric vehicle can be charged. A Charge Point has one or more
connectors.

|*Charging Profile* | Generic Charging Profile, used for different types of Profiles. Contains information about the Profile and holds the <<chargingschedule,Charging Schedule>>. In future versions of OCPP it might hold more than 1 <<chargingschedule,Charging Schedule>>.

|*Charging Schedule* | Part of a Charging Profile. Defines a block of charging Power or Current limits.
Can contain a start time and length.

|*Charging Session* |Part of a transaction during which the EV is allowed to request energy

|*Composite Charging Schedule* |The charging schedule as calculated by the Charge Point. It is the result of the calculation of all active schedules and possible local limits present in the Charge Point. Also IEC 15118 limits might be taken into account.

|*Connector* |The term “Connector”, as used in this specification,
refers to an independently operated and managed electrical outlet on a
Charge Point. This usually corresponds to a single physical connector,
but in some cases a single outlet may have multiple physical socket
types and/or tethered cable/connector arrangements to facilitate
different vehicle types (e.g. four-wheeled EVs and electric scooters).

|*Control Pilot signal* | signal used by a Charge Point to inform EV
of maximum Charging power or current limit, as defined by <<ref-IEC61851,[IEC61851-1]>>.

|[[energy-transfer-period]] *Energy Transfer Period* | Time during which an EV chooses to take offered energy, or return it. Multiple Energy Transfer Periods are possible during a Transaction.

|*Local Controller* |Optional device in a smart charging infrastructure. Located on the premises with a number of Charge Points connected to it. Sits between the Charge Points and Central System. Understands and speaks OCPP messages. Controls the Power or Current in other Charge Point by using OCPP smart charging messages. Can be a Charge Point itself.
|*OCPP-J*| OCPP via JSON over WebSocket
|*OCPP-S*| OCPP via SOAP
|*Phase Rotation*| Defines the wiring order of the phases between the energy meter (or if absent, the grid connection), and the Charge Point connector.

|[[transaction]] *Transaction* | The part of the charging process that starts when all relevant preconditions (e.g. authorization, plug inserted) are met, and ends at the moment when the Charge Point irrevocably leaves this state.

|*String* | Case Sensitive String. Only printable ASCII allowed.
All strings in messages and enumerations are case sensitive, unless
explicitly stated otherwise.

| *FR/NF/C*                            | Identifies whether it is a functional requirement, non-functional requirement or a constraint.
| *Functional requirement*             | Functional requirements are requirements that specify a function that a system or system component must be able to perform.
| *Non-functional requirement*         | Non-functional requirements are requirements which are not specifically concerned with the functionality of a system but place restrictions on the product being developed
| *Constraint*                         | Constraints are a type of non-functional requirement that is imposed by the client that restricts the implementation of the system or the development process.
| *ID*                                 | Use-case identification number.
| *Use-case*                           | A use case is a specification of sequences of actions, including variant sequences and error sequences, that a system, subsystem, or class can perform by interacting with outside actors
| *Actor*                              | The actor(s) involved in the use-cases and associated requirements.
| *Precondition*                    | Lists the conditions that must be true before the Use Case starts
| *ID*                                 | Requirement identification number.
| *Requirement definition*             | The condition or capability needed by a user, Charge Point and Central System to satisfy the contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document.
| *M/O/C*                              | This column defines whether requirements are mandatory (M) or optional (O) or conditional (C) for the instantiation of a specific logical node.

| *Rationale*                          | The logical basis for the requirement.
| *Note*                               | Extra annotations required for understaning of the requirement.
| *Requirement OCPP 1.6 specification* | Former requirement specification.
| *Specification part*                 | Section of OCPP 1.6 specification document.
