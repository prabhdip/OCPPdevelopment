|*No.*  | *Type* | *Description*
|*1*    | *Use case element name*  | Download Firmware Update
|*2*    | *ID*                     | UC.XX
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | When a Charge Point is notified about new firmware, it needs to be able to download this firmware.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case covers how the Central System can notify a Charge Point that it needs to update its firmware.
                                     When a Charge Point is notified about new firmware, it needs to be able to download this firmware.
|       | _Actors_                 | CPO, Charge Point, Central System
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* The Central System notifies the Charge Point that it needs to update its firmware. +
                                     *2.* The Central System sends a <<updateFirmware.req,UpdateFirmware.req>> PDU to instruct the Charge Point
                                     to install new firmware. +
                                     *3.* Upon receipt of an <<updateFirmware.req,UpdateFirmware.req>> PDU, the Charge Point responds with a
                                     <<updateFirmware.conf,UpdateFirmware.conf>> PDU. +
                                     *4.* The Charge Point retrieves the firmware and starts installing it.
|       | _Alternative scenarios_  |
|*5*    | *Prerequisites*          | *1.* The Profile _Firmware Management_ is installed.
                                     *2.* If an firmware update is needed. +
|*6*    | *Postconditions*         | *Successful postconditions:* Successful installation of new firmware +
                                     *Failure postconditions:* Unsuccessful installation of new firmware.

|*8*    | *Error handling*         |
|*9*    | *Remarks*                | The Charge Point SHOULD start retrieving the firmware as soon as possible after retrieve-date. +
                                     It is recommended that the firmware is downloaded via FTP or FTPS. FTP(S) is better
                                     optimized for large binary data than HTTP. Also FTP(S) has the ability
                                     to resume downloads. In case a download is interrupted, the Charge Point
                                     can resume downloading after the part it already has downloaded. The FTP
                                     URL is of format:
                                     __ftp:__//__user__:__password__@__host__:__port__/_path_ in which the
                                     parts __user__:__password__@, :__password__ or :__port__ may be
                                     excluded. +

                                     To ensure that the correct firmware is downloaded, it is RECOMMENDED
                                     that the firmware is also digitally signed.
